        <button class="faq-question">01. Which animal (cows, buffalos, or both) should you select for your dairy farm?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>There are many factors involved in choosing the right species of livestock for your farm. While cows produce more milk than the buffalos do, the buffalo milk is high in FAT content comparatively. That is why farmers prefer milking the buffalos for local selling as their milk reaps more money than the cows.</p>
